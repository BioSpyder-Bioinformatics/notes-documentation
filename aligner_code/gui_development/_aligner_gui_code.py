# Available widgets (in tk)
# Label
# Button
# Entry (allows only 1 line entry)
# Text (allows multiline entry) 
# Frame (rectangel used to group related widgets)#

# TKK also brings in
# Progress bar
# Better looks
# Much more

# Create a window -> instance of Tkinter class

# Retrieve stuff with .get(), delete with .delete() and insert with .insert()


# For multi line everything is the same except for .get() that needs to get the slice of characters to retrieve (usually to get all line, in this case first line) text_box.get('1.0', tk.END) tk.END gets everything until the end

# For frames you need to declare the components inside the frame directly inside it



# Send the window in loop so that it does persist
