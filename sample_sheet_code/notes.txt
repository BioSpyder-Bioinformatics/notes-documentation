Do need:
- Export sample sheet template in xlsx (Make template with cells in red)
- Support 96 + 48 tables

- On reupload - support both csv and xlsx formats
- On reupload - get_tables() needs to recognise if the table is 24/48/96
    + Also it's best to do the sample names checks here!


- Check number of samples loaded. (In dash you need to confirm with the user this was the right amount added)
	- For multiple 96 plates, specific number of controls!!
	- Blanks get ignored
	
- In dash, you don't need to check if the file exists in the directory!!

- Add some tests? What is worth testing?


ASK SALVO
- 48-24 wells indexes have some of the 800 series!!
