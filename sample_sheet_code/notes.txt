Do need:
- Export sample sheet template in xlsx (Make template with cells in red)
- On reupload - support both csv and xlsx formats
- On reupload - get_tables() needs to recognise if the table is 24/48/96
- Check number of samples loaded. (In dash you need to confirm with the user this was the right amount added)
	- For multiple 96 plates, specific number of controls!!
	- Blanks get ignored

- Add some tests? What is worth testing?
