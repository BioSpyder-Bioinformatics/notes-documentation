# Ras-Raf project

Ras and Raf genes are the most commonly mutated genes in cancer. The peculiarity is that different mutations/SNPs carry different types of risks.
Ras-Raf diagnostic kits currently are based on qt-PCR techniques.

Tempo-Seq is applied to this project on the genomic data, on SNP-prone and polimorphic sites. 

Issues include: 
- Dropout: stochastic events that fluctuate read counts, mainly given by low input
- Noise: ligation in polimorphic sites causes 


One off analysis required when things go wrong:
- Blast all of the probes, if there is background noise, check for multiple ligation (?)


This project will at some point converge with the liquid biopsy project, as we'll be analysing free DNA in the plasma.
